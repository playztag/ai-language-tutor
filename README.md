# GPT Foreign Language Tutor

GPT Foreign Language Tutor is an AI-powered language learning platform that aims to help users learn new languages in a more intuitive and immersive way. By simulating a conversation with a native speaker, the application helps learners practice their listening comprehension and speaking skills without the fear or embarrassment of interacting with a real person.

## Supported Languages

The current languages supported by the GPT Foreign Language Tutor are:

-   English (US)
-   Spanish (Spain)
-   Spanish (Mexico)
-   Chinese (Mandarin)
-   French
-   German
-   Italian
-   Portuguese (Brazil)
-   Russian
-   Japanese
-   Korean

We plan to expand the list of supported languages as we receive feedback from users on the initial set of languages.

## User Interface and Features

The user interface is designed to feel like having a chat with a native speaker, with both text and voice input/output. Users can either type or dictate their message, and the AI will respond with feedback in text and spoken form. Our goal is to create an intuitive and frictionless experience for language learners.

## Installation and Usage

To test the web-based GPT Foreign Language Tutor, visit [lang.ztag.com](https://lang.ztag.com/). If you'd like to run the application locally, you will need API keys from OpenAI and Amazon Polly. The current implementation is built on Node.js, and we are seeking developers to help create a dedicated app for the platform.

## Limitations and Contributions

Some current limitations of the GPT Foreign Language Tutor include:

-   No historical knowledge of the chat for the AI model
-   Audio not working on all browsers (e.g., mobile devices)
-   Crude interface with no option to pause audio playback

We welcome contributions to improve the GPT Foreign Language Tutor. To get involved, please submit pull requests on GitHub.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to ChatGPT, Amazon Polly, AWS, and all the other technologies that made it possible to create this mockup in just one day.
