## Coding Conventions and Style Guidelines

As much of our code is AI-generated, we recommend adhering to the following best practices:

1. Follow the existing code formatting and style as closely as possible.
2. Use meaningful variable and function names that accurately describe their purpose.
3. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
4. Include comments where necessary to explain complex or non-obvious code.
5. When in doubt, refer to established style guides like [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) or [Google's Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), depending on the language used in the project.

## Testing Changes

Before submitting a pull request, please test your changes:

1. Run any existing unit tests to ensure that your changes don't break existing functionality.
2. Perform manual testing to verify that your changes work as expected in different browsers and environments.

## Additional Expectations and Guidelines

1. Be respectful and considerate of others when discussing issues or submitting pull requests.
2. Understand that your changes may be modified or adapted to better fit the project's goals or requirements.
3. Be patient, as it may take some time for the project maintainers to review your contributions.
